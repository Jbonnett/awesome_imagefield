All of this code was written while employed by the wonderful folks at the Center for Investigative Reporting, and was cleared for release by Joquin Alverado and myself.
Because of the nature of this code extraction, the commits are going to look like they all came from Joshua Bonnett. 

That is a bug, not a feature.
