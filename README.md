Awesome_Imagefield
==========

A django image field extracted from work done over the years on a news cms. 

awesome_imagefield - this app contains the static files, templates, fields and widgets. This is what you will want to use in your site.

example_app - this should show you how to use the image field along with providing a bare minimum basis for (eventual) tests.


Tests? we don't need no sticking tests......Well, if you write them we will use them, we just haven't cracked js testing in the admin yet.
